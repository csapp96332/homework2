              <p> "I started my career working as a Teller in a branch at TruMark Finanical Credit Union right out of high school
                in 1988.  Within three years I had been promoted up to assistant manager and within another 3 years I was running the entire 
                branch network.  During that time, I taught myself how to code basic websites using Front Page.  I was able to build crude 
                workflow applications for processes such as Wires, loan issues, and such.  They were as complex as having an approval process 
                and the ability to edit existing requests.  It had an Access database in the back end.  I was very proud of what I had built.
              </p>
              <p>
                That went on for the first 16 years of my career, that was until TruMark hired a new CEO and he brought
                in his own staff.  At that point I was shifted to the back office and that is where my path to electronic services and project 
                management.  My first big project was our home banking conversion.  Even though there were some bumps, overall the project was a success.
                  We were able to add ACH transfers and real time mobile deposit.  That continued until 2014 when Police and Fire Federal Credit 
                Union recruited me to be thier first Business Analyst.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working for PFFCU I managed a number of larger projects during their core conversion as well as handling a number of programming projects
                for the core called Power On, which is a  procedural language.  Since then I now manage a dozen or so IT projects and manager 3-4 staff 
                members.  Every day is an adventure and I am looking forward to seeing where the future takes me.
