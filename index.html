            of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,

            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to 
            obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and 
            pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man 
            who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces 
            no resultant pleasure?"
